This repo is a place for me to put reimplementations of various cryptography algorithms that I write.

Likely none of these will be performant but I hope to learn a lot by reimplementing these algorithms in a clear manner.

The first set of algorithms that I'll reimplement are ChaCha20 and Poly1305 as described in [RFC 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8439.html).
